Your Jenkins pipeline script looks good with the added echo statements and the mail step to include the build log as an attachment. This script will run through the defined stages and send email notifications with the build log attachment in case of success or failure.

Make sure that the build log file is generated during the pipeline execution and that it follows the expected naming and path specified in attachmentsPattern. If the log file is named differently or located in a different directory, adjust the attachmentsPattern accordingly.

You can now use this Jenkins pipeline script to automate your build and deployment process while receiving email notifications with the build logs as attachments upon pipeline completion.

To address the issues in your Jenkins pipeline script, I've made some adjustments. Below is the modified script:

groovy
Copy code
pipeline {
    agent any
    stages {
        stage('Build') {
            steps {
                echo '--- Building the code ---'
                sh 'mvn clean package'
            }
        }
        stage('Unit and Integration Tests') {
            steps {
                echo '--- Running unit and integration tests ---'
                sh 'mvn test'
            }
        }
        stage('Code Analysis') {
            steps {
                echo '--- Performing code analysis ---'
                // Add code analysis tool commands here
                // Example: sh 'sonar-scanner'
            }
        }
        stage('Security Scan') {
            steps {
                echo '--- Performing security scan ---'
                // Add security scanning tool commands here
                // Example: sh 'zap-cli --quick-scan -t http://your-app-url'
            }
        }
        stage('Deploy to Staging') {
            steps {
                echo '--- Deploying to staging environment ---'
                // Add deployment commands here
                // Example: sh 'aws deploy create-deployment ...'
            }
        }
        stage('Integration Tests on Staging') {
            steps {
                echo '--- Running integration tests on staging environment ---'
                // Add integration tests on staging commands here
                // Example: sh 'mvn verify -Pstaging'
            }
        }
        stage('Deploy to Production') {
            steps {
                echo '--- Deploying to production environment ---'
                // Add deployment to production commands here
                // Example: sh 'aws deploy create-deployment ...'
            }
        }
    }
    post {
        success {
            echo '--- Pipeline Successful ---'
            // Send success notification email with logs as attachment
            emailext subject: 'Pipeline Successful',
                body: 'The Jenkins pipeline has completed successfully. See attached build log for details.',

        }
        failure {

            emailext subject: 'Pipeline Failed',

    }
